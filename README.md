# About this App

The application implements the mechanism for displaying a list of products on the page. Each product is presented with its unique identifier, name, price, and brand.

Users can navigate between pages of the product list, viewing up to 50 products per page. Pagination allows convenient navigation through a large number of products.

The application also features functionality to filter the list of products by name, price, and brand. Users can specify filter criteria, and the application will display only those products that match the specified parameters.
